# python-audit_hook_head_finder

This POC intends to show how to find the audit hook and use `ctypes` to pop it (~~SMASH it~~).

The idea is inspired by `misc/diligent-auditor` and `misc/IRS` challeneges and their solve scripts from [`dicectf-quals-2024` CTF](https://github.com/dicegang/dicectf-quals-2024-challenges/).

## How to use
```bash
./build.sh
./POC.py
python POC2.py
```
